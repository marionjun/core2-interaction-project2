      In life, the number of
      <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginnings</span> is
      exactly equal to the number of <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>endings</span></button>: no one has yet to begin a life who
      will not end it.<br /><br />
      In poetry, the number of
      <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginnings</span> so far
      exceeds the number of <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>endings</span></button> that we cannot even conceive of it. Not
      every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is
      carried away by the wind, which may be an <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>ending</span></button>, but it is the <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>ending</span></button> of
      a poem without an end. <br /><br />Paul Valéry, the French poet and
      thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely
      abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where
      quotations begin is in a cloud. <br /><br />Paul Valéry also described his
      perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i
      have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like
      finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen
      before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit
      would fall. <br /><br />In the
      <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span> was the
      Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a
      lively group of thinkers who believe that in the <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span> was the Act.
      that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before
      act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. <br /><br />I believe the
      poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of
      a poem than it is to talk about its
      <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span>. Because
      the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the
      mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will;
      somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a
      chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.
      <br /><br />An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest.
      Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility.
      And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! But
      the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct
      oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem
      by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend,
      feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness
      is its own pretension, and has been from its
      <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span>; the
      human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph angel
      puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the
      weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an
      animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no
      theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and
      observe it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is
      theatre.
