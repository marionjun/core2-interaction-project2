      The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The
      image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never
      claim.” <br><br>Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses
      text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante.
      Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they
      see expressed in Twombly’s work. <br><br>Bachelard’s sentence simply says this:
      origins (<span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginnings</span>) have consequences (<button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>endings</span></button>). <br><br>The poem is the
      consequence of its origins. Give me the fruit and I will take from it a
      see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. <br><br>Barbara
      Henstein Smith, in her book <i>Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End</i>, says
      this: “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that
      varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our
      experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever
      tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of
      terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations
      that are aroused are also fulfilled.” <br><br>But there is no book I know of on
      the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin be <i>traced</i> when there is
      no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the
      moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the
      <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span>, before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to
      the precise <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span> because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t
      “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born. <br><br>I have flipped through
      books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across
      cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that first lines
      are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are remarkably
      similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably
      distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. And i
      began to realize, reading these first and last lines, that there are not
      only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak but
      also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to
      use by others, by those we listen to. And in the best of all possible
      lives, that <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span> and that <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>end</span></button> are the same: in poem after poem I
      encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that
      we hear as children repeated night after night, like a refrain: <i>I love
      you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now.</i> And I
      encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that
      we hope to hear on earth: <i>I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid.
      Go to sleep now.</i> <br><br><i>But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is
      rising.</i> Among Emily Dickinson’s last words (in a letter). A woman whom
      everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, cloistered, spoke as if she had
      been <i>out</i>, exploring the earth, her whole life, and it was finally time to
      go in. And it was.
