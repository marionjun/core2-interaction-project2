      Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the
      answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a
      rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the
      lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the
      most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an
      exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the
      top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be
      learned by trial and error. <br><br>I believe many fine poems begin with ideas,
      but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get
      the wrong idea. <br><br>Now here is something really interesting (to me),
      something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired
      of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five
      words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from
      Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among
      them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That
      sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and
      ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in
      a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are
      blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be
      sorry to hear the sentence end. <br><br>When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong
      sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>semicolons</span></button>!” he is absolutely right;
      the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a
      savant, but the next time you use a <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>semicolon</span></button> (which, by the way, is the
      least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be
      thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an
      Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting
      speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. <br><br>You might say a poem
      <i>is</i> a <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>semicolon</span></button>, a living <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>semicolon</span></button>, what connects the first line to the
      last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart.
      Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not
      for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not
      speak to each other.
