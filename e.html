      Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to
      each other, not you to them or they to you. <br><br>I will tell you what I miss: I
      miss watching a movie and at <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>the end</span></button>, huge scrolled words come on the
      screen and say: <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>The End</span></button>. I miss finishing a novel and there on the last
      page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are
      the dark letters spelling <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>The End</span></button>. <br><br>It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore
      them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling:
      both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the
      feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book. <br><br>I have never, in
      my life, read a poem that ended with the words <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span><i>The End</i></span></button>. Why is that, I
      wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one
      feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy
      of pulling tape across the finish line. And then I found a poem of mine
      that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom
      of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text,
      were the words <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span><i>The End</i></span></button>. And I realized children very often denote <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>the end</span></button>
      because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written
      anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and
      poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but have
      not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons
      residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like
      kings. Which is a wonderful thing. <br><br>Roland Barthes suggests there are three
      ways to finish any piece of writing: the <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>ending</span></button> will have the last word or
      the <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>ending</span></button> will be silent or the <button class="button" type="button" data-hover=";" data-active="I'M ACTIVE"><span>ending</span></button> will execute a pirouette, do
      something unexpectedly incongruent. <br><br>Gaston Bachelard says the single most
      succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end by
      organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience
      of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the
      moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its
      dignification; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of
      some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself
      but how we can organize it, think about it. <br><br>I am afraid there is no way
      around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that,
      then you are conceding that in the <span class="beginning" onclick="scrollToTop()">beginning</span> was the act, not the word.
